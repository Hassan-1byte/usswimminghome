        the United States. We promote the culture of swimming by creating safe
        and healthy opportunities for athletes and coaches of all backgrounds to
        participate and advance in the sport through clubs, events and
        education. Our membership is comprised of swimmers of every age and
        ability, all the way up to the Olympic Team, as well as coaches,
